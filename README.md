# SafetyHubs.io

Safety Hubs are community-operated spaces focused on:
- Safety
- Stability
- Recovery
- Education
- Mutual accountability

This is not a profit-first project.
This is infrastructure for people.

## What This Is
- A framework for community safety hubs
- A technical + operational model
- Open-source by design
- Built to work with churches, unused buildings, and local stewards

## What This Is Not
- Not a pump
- Not a DAO circus
- Not a VC experiment
- Not surveillance tech

## Guiding Principle
Build first. Prove it works. Let growth follow integrity.

## Status
Early foundation phase.
Documentation-first.
Pilot hubs in planning.

## Stewardship
This project is stewarded under the bsmeter umbrella.
Integrity > speed.
